# Fake News Detection
This project  aims to classify news as either real or fake using machine learning algorithms. It uses a dataset of news articles that have been labeled as either real or fake, and implements various machine learning algorithms to train models that can accurately predict the veracity of new unseen news articles.

### _Steps_
1. Download the dataset: [MEGA Link]
2. Run _Preprocessing.ipynb_ first.
3. Run _Visualization.ipynb_ (optional) and _Models.ipynb_.
4. Run _Prediction.ipynb_.

### _Requirements_
1. Python3
